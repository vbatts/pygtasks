DESCRIPTION:
 pygtasks is presently a very simple tool, that shows your Google tasks

TODO:
 * Move the client functions into the pygclient class
 * describe 'tasks' and 'tasklists' into more of a class/module 
 * implement a 'setup.py' so that this project can be packagable
 * build out the features of a task
 ** add
 ** del
 ** complete
 ** indent
 ** reorder
 ** schedule
 ** notes
 * ultimately:
 ** do some level of caching/synchronizing

GETTING STARTED:
 * Install google-api-python-client
   ( if you a slackware user, I have a SlackBuild at
     https://github.com/vbatts/SlackBuilds/tree/master/google-api-python-client )
 * Run the commands
 $> git clone git://github.com/vbatts/pygtasks.git
 $> cd pygtasks
 $> python main.py

 * The first run of this will create the file ~/.config/pygtasks/pygtasks.cfg
   with bunk data
 * Go create (for yourself) an application "project" at the Google API Console
 ** Services - "Tasks API" (and if you want to play with the translate_text.py, then "Translate API" as well)
 ** API Access
 *** Click "Create an OAuth 2.0 client ID" button
 *** Product name "pygtasks" -> Next button
 *** Choose "Installed Application" -> Create client ID button
 ** Use the API Acces information to update pygtasks.cfg
   
 P.S. the "developerKey" needed, is the "API KEY"
